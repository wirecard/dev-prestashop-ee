## Additional Credit Card Configuration Field
With the new major release of the Wirecard PrestaShop Module comes an updated Credit Card configuration form. **Wirecard Payment Page v2 Address (WPP v2 URL)** has been added as an additional configuration field. **WPP v2 URL** is pre-configured with test data. If you update to the new product version, the Credit Card configuration will adjust automatically. However, we still recommend checking your settings. If you need to change your Credit Card configuration, a tooltip will provide additional information. For further details, or if you have any questions, contact [Wirecard Support](https://github.com/wirecard/prestashop-ee/wiki/Contact-Information).

## PSD2 
The Wirecard PrestaShop Module is **[PSD2](https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_PSD2) compliant.**  

The [**P**ayment **S**ervice **D**irective 2 (PSD2)](https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_PSD2) aims to reduce fraud in the European e-commerce sector. Most card fraud in Europe happens in card-not-present transactions. For this reason, PSD2 makes [**S**trong **C**ustomer **A**uthentication (SCA)](https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_PSD2_SCA) mandatory for consumer-initiated online payments. The new standard authentication method for credit card transactions is [**3DS2**](https://doc.wirecard.com/CreditCard.html#CreditCard_3DS2). It follows the strict SCA requirements.  
PSD2 comes into full effect on September 14, 2019.
