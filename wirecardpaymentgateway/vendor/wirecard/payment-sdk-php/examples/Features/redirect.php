// # Redirect with synchronous payments

// At synchronous payment processes the first response already contains the information, that the funds were
// successfully reserved or transferred and the person paying does not need to be redirected to a page from
// a financial service provider. For integration it is sometimes useful, if the responses are similar. Therefore
// the SDK will create a `FormRedirectResponse` for synchronous payment methods, if a redirect URL is provided.

// ## Required objects

// To include the necessary files, use the composer for PSR-4 autoloading.

// The redirect functionality is illustrated using a credit card transaction, which is synchronous
// for non 3-D Secure transactions.
$transaction = new CreditCardTransaction();

// ### Redirects

// The redirect URLs are defined in a corresponding object.
$redirectUrl = new Redirect(
// A URL for successful transactions is expected.
    getUrl('../CreditCard/return.php?status=success')
);

// Set the redirect URL to enable the functionality.
$transaction->setRedirect(($redirectUrl));


// ### Transaction Service

// The service is used to execute the reservation (authorization) operation itself.
$transactionService = new TransactionService($config);
$response = $transactionService->reserve($transaction);


// ## Response handling

// The response from the service can be used for disambiguation.
// Since the redirect URL is set, a `FormInteractionResponse` will be returned, if the request was successful.
